> *What do Flappy Bird, React Native, and an AIML student have in common?*  
> This game. Built from scratch with 💙, bugs, and a lot of “why isn’t this working?!”

## 🧠 About the Game

**Paper Plane Adventure** is a simple, addictive 2D mobile game where you guide a brave little paper plane through randomly generated jungle pipes (yes, they’re not Mario pipes, but close enough). Inspired by Flappy Bird, coded using React Native and TypeScript — because why not mix mobile dev and chaos?

## 👩‍💻 Built With Love (and Debugging)

- **React Native** (because native apps scare me a little)
- **TypeScript** (because I love bugs *with* types)
- **Expo CLI** (because building native SDKs from scratch is not for the weak)

---

## 🔥 Features

- Tap-to-fly mechanic that’s *just challenging enough to ruin your high score streak*
- Parallax scrolling clouds – yes, I know what that means now
- Procedurally generated obstacles – fancy way to say "stuff spawns randomly"
- Real-time collision detection that’s unforgiving in the best way
- A restart button… because you’ll need it. A lot.

## 🛠 What I Learned

* Game loops, animation frames, and how gravity ruins everything
* Proper component structure in React Native
* Making something *fun* without fancy libraries or engines

---

## 🧃 Bonus

* It's surprisingly addictive
* It's resume material (You’re literally reading it, hi!)
* It’s a working project — not just tutorial-copy-paste™
